# 🩺 Medical Assistant Chatbot

This is a **lightweight AI-powered medical assistant** designed to provide concise, patient-friendly answers. It leverages **Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, and **OpenAI** models to generate responses, then intelligently selects the best one to present. Built with Python, Gradio, and Pydantic.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **User inputs a medical question** in the chat interface.
2. The system:
   - Uses **Gemini** and **DeepSeek** to generate responses.
   - Passes both responses to **OpenAI GPT-4** for evaluation.
   - Selects and returns the **best answer**.
   - Extracts the **topic** and **summary** using Gemini, and logs them.
3. **Gradio** serves the web interface with dark mode enforced.
